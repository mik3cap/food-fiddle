## Clean Data

The clean_data directory obviously contains properly clean and ready to use
data files. When you're satisfied that you've completed all the work you can 
on a particular dataset, simply copy it here to show that it's done.

Generally clean data files will not go back into working_data unless they for
some reason will need to be combined with other datasets. These files are
considered to be ready for use in any kind of visualization or analysis type
research projects.
