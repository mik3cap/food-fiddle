## USA Metadata

This is a dataset in process that will serve as a useful corpora for data 
analysis and visualization projects. It contains important metadata for
each of the regions in the United States that could possibly be referred
to in other datasets. It is saved as a JSON file in order to be maximally 
useful.

Right now it is halfway between a CSV file and a JSON file, and just needs 
to be finished being formatted into JSON.
